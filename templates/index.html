            <p class="paragraph"><strong>Team Mission</strong> <br>According to the World Health Organization, disability affects one billion people globally; UBC Uplift intends to help individuals in the subset of this population afflicted with various muscular and neurological disabilities. These people often experience difficulties with holding and transporting items, and moving about their living spaces - daily tasks that are incredibly taxing or impossible to perform regularly. Thus, a long-term solution is essential to improving the quality of life of these individuals. <br><br>This team is currently working to develop a device to assist our client, who suffers from post-polio syndrome. By applying biomedical engineering principles, we hope to help our client live safely and comfortably at home while engaging with the community in which we live and learn.<br><br><strong>How it All Started<br></strong>Following the end of our first year of engineering at UBC, we were excited by all that we have learned, yet we yearn to pursue more design work to apply our knowledge and make an impact through engineering. Ultimately, we wanted to use our skills and knowledge to create meaningful change in our community. Our leadership roles on the proposed UBC Uplift project allow us to learn and further challenge ourselves while providing our team members with opportunities to do the same.<strong><br></strong><br><strong>Projects &amp; Collaborations<br></strong>UBC Uplift’s current project is in collaboration with the Makers Making Change program through the Neil Squire Society. <br>‍<br>Our project is centered around the effects of post-polio syndrome on our clients daily life.  Symptoms of this condition typically become evident over a decade after recovery from the initial polio infection when the repaired motor neurons begin to deteriorate. Post-polio has caused paralysis of our clients legs, and as a result, she requires two (2) braces and two (2) crutches to move around. As her hands must be used to grasp the crutches and hold herself up, she struggles to perform secondary tasks, namely carrying objects such as her bedpan, laundry items, and telephone, while walking about her living space. Furthermore, care aids will soon become less accessible to our client, so she will be responsible for regularly performing the tasks that her care aids currently assist her with - many of which are very dangerous and require excessive amounts of effort for our client in her present condition.<strong><br></strong><br></p>
