                    A common challenge encountered on the IMDI trip was with the use, maintenance and disposal of
                    donated medical equipment. Studies have shown that as much of 70% of donated medical equipment
                    is never put into use in recipient countries. There are many factors that contribute to this
                    problem, for example a lack of training to use the equipment and technical manuals.
                    Often technical considerations are not accounted for when equipment is donated â€“ such as
                    differences in voltage between countries, and power fluctuations common to low resource
                    settings.
                    This project aims to further research these challenges, as well as the donation practices of
                    hospitals in Canada, and to identify possible avenues in which this challenge can be addressed
                    and improved.

                    Approximately 800,000 people suffer from a stroke each year; about one every four seconds.
                    Suffering a stroke results in the weakness and or loss of function in the body. Often times,
                    those who have suffered from a stroke undergo a repetitive rehabilitation process in order to
                    recover important daily functions. Music to Movement is a student body led initiative aimed at
                    developing an assistive music therapy device that creates a more motivating and engaging
                    experience towards recovery. One year since inception, Music to Movement has emerged through the
                    collaboration of all the sub teams of UBC BEST, and the extensive research and guidance from our
                    partnered music therapists.

                    Phototherapy is a treatment used in Newborn Units in hospitals to treat babies with severe
                    jaundice. During the treatment, infants are placed under phototherapeutic light, which is
                    primarily blue, for a recommended 7 day period. On International Medical Device Initiative
                    (IMDI) trip to East Africa in May 2015, multiple medical professionals in both Kenya and Uganda
                    expressed the uncertainty in knowing if the bulbs used by the phototherapy units were working
                    effectively.
                    Although light is being emitted, there is no indication that there is enough blue
                    light present for the treatment to be completed within the recommended time.
                    <br><br>
                    As bulbs degrade over time, they begin to produce less and less blue light.
                    A consequence of insufficient blue light is that babies are left under the phototherapy light
                    for longer than the recommended
                    period of treatment. Such prolonged exposure to the intense light of phototherapy bulbs can
                    cause
                    skin damage.
                    The end goal of the project is to create a device that can monitor the level of blue light being
                    emitted from phototherapy bulbs, and notify the doctors and nurses if the bulb is functioning
                    efficiently, or if it needs to be changed.

                    The Respiratory Rate Monitor Project is based on a proposal from the teamâ€™s recent International
                    Medical Device Initiative (IMDI), where 4 team members travelled to Uganda and Kenya in May 2015
                    to speak to medical professionals about the challenges that they face in performing care for
                    patients. The challenge was initially brought to the team by a paediatrician in Uganda who
                    expressed the need for a device to actively monitor the respiratory rate of patients, and alert
                    a healthcare professional when the rate drops, or if the breathing becomes shallow. Further
                    investigation showed that often respiratory rate can be difficult to take, and is often
                    neglected as a vital that should be actively monitored. The team hopes to develop a device to
                    address these issues and optimize healthcare professionalsâ€™ ability to perform care.

                    Traction is commonly used in international and low resource settings to treat bone fractures, mainly
                    femur fractures, by pulling the bones into alignment and maintaining that alignment for long periods
                    of time. There are a number of challenges associated with this process. For example, patients can be
                    immobile for up to 3 months while undergoing traction, which results in prolonged usage of hospital
                    resources and bed space that is increasingly scarce. This projectâ€™s purpose is primarily to research
                    the feasibility of designing a compact device that performs the same mechanics on the leg as
                    traction, but allowing for more patient mobility and decreasing the fracture healing time, thus

                    Diagnosis of malaria, tuberculosis, typhoid, and other blood borne diseases is a pressing issue in
                    East Africa. Current diagnostic techniques are either not feasible in low resource settings, or

                    To improve the effectiveness of diagnosing haematologic diseases in low resource settings, a

                    then analyzed by the application. The application marks certain features of the blood sample such as
                    red blood cells, white blood cells, and plasma, to be examined later by doctors.

                    Our challenge, as the Microscope Phone Holder Attachment Team, is to design a mechanical device that
                    aligns the attaches the phone and phone camera to the lens of a microscope. The phone needs to be
                    attached firmly and securely to the microscope. At the same time, the phoneâ€™s position and alignment
                    must be easy to adjust.
                    <br><br>
                    Our team of mechanical engineering and engineering physics students is currently working to design a
                    convenient, stable, and adaptable â€˜phone holderâ€™ attachment for microscopes, that can be 3D printed
                    on-site.
