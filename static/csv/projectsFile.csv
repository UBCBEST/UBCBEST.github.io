femur,fa-chain-broken,FFTP,Femur Fracture Treatment Project,FFTP,"Trauma is a major cause of death and disability worldwide and motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries, with femur fractures being the most common musculoskeletal injury. Effective femoral surgery is not easily accessible to patients in low income countries and as a result, patients are treated with other methods. One of the most common treatments is called skeletal traction, a non-surgical method of realigning bones through constant force application. It is a method that requires few resources and is not deemed surgical, but constrains a patient to a bed for 2-3 months and is often accompanied by complications including pin-tract infection, malunion, nonunion, blood clots, and pressure sores. The Femur Fracture Treatment Project team aims to design a device that aligns and maintains alignment of a broken femur, while being compact and allowing more mobility than current methods. The project aims to design a device that will produce better patient outcomes, increase mobility, and decrease hospital cost and bed time compared to current traction treatment.The team is currently prototyping various designs of the device, while also conducting research on bone and fracture mechanics and bone healing.  The team is working with a group of Orthopaedic Medicine students in Uganda to develop the device so it is context appropriate and will be successful in improving traction treatment in low income countries."
bit,fa-flask,BIT,Biochemical Innovation Team,BIT,"BIT aims to explore and innovate medical solutions in the biochemical area of biomedical engineering. This includes stem cell technology, tissue printing, drug and gene delivery, genetic and protein engineering, and nanosystems."
en,fa-hand-paper-o,ENABLE,ENABLE,ENABLE,"Enable is a team made up of dedicated students who are developing an upper body exoskeleton that provides assistance to users with reduced mobility. We aim to construct an exoskeleton that is affordable and can be utilized on a day-to-day basis or used as a rehabilitation tool. Our team has a diverse group of students (Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Kinesiology, Integrated Engineering) who are eager to design assistive technologies and expand their knowledge of biomedical engineering."
rrm,fa-mixcloud,RRM,Respiratory Rate Monitor,RRM,"Each year, over one million children under the age of 5 die due to acute respiratory infections. The majority of these deaths occur in low resource countries, where hospitals often do not have the necessary personnel or equipment to constantly monitor the respiratory rate of paediatric patients. Measuring a patient’s respiratory rate is vital in the clinical assessment for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. The team aims to develop a low cost, context appropriate monitoring device that continuously reads a patient's respiratory rate and alerts a medical professional when the patient is in distress. Currently developing their second iteration prototype, the team is exploring accelerometer technology to use in their designs.  This project closed in 2019 and the work has been open sourced here: https://github.com/UBCBEST/resp-rate."
ptm,fa-leaf,MINT,Medical Innovation in NeuroTechnology,MINT,"We are a diverse group of students (Nursing, Psychology, COGS, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Computer Science, etc) eager to make an impact.  Our mission is to build our capacity to tackle neurotechnology challenges, foster a collaborative network of professionals, enthusiasts and the general public.  We also aim to bridge the clinical and social aspects of neuroscience by accessibly reproducing and innovating upon notable experiments and technologies.  We have our own website at https://ubcmint.github.io."
m2m,fa-music,M2M,Music 2 Movement,M2M,"Approximately 800,000 people suffer from a stroke each year; about one every four seconds. Suffering a stroke results in the weakness and or loss of function in the body. Often times, those who have suffered from a stroke undergo a repetitive rehabilitation process in order to recover important daily functions. Music to Movement is a student body led initiative aimed at developing an assistive music therapy device that creates a more motivating and engaging experience towards recovery. Two years since inception, Music to Movement has emerged through the collaboration of all the sub teams of UBC BEST, and the extensive research and guidance from our partnered music therapists. Along with strong continued development, M2M has been featured as finalists at the MDDC Awards for Excellence in Biomedical Engineering Design and Innovation as well as for the RESNA (Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America) Student Design Competition Award."
mast,fa-code,MAST,Medical Applications and Software Team,MAST,"The Medical Applications and Software Team (MAST), is a new project starting under BEST this year in 2019. UBC BEST was very recently approached by Vancouver General Hospital’s Emergency and Trauma Radiology Department to develop a mobile application for both patient and radiologist use in acute settings."
uplift,fa-walking,UPLIFT,UPLIFT,UPLIFT,"According to the World Health Organization, disability affects one billion people globally; UBC Uplift intends to help individuals in the subset of this population afflicted with various muscular and neurological disabilities. These people often experience difficulties with holding and transporting items, and moving about their living spaces - daily tasks that are incredibly taxing or impossible to perform regularly. Thus, a long-term solution is essential to improving the quality of life of these individuals. This team is currently working with a client suffering from post-polio."
