        "A common challenge encountered on the IMDI trip was with the use, maintenance and disposal of donated medical equipment. Studies have shown that as much of 70% of donated medical equipment is never put into use in recipient countries. There are many factors that contribute to this problem, for example a lack of training to use the equipment and technical manuals. Often technical considerations are not accounted for when equipment is donated – such as differences in voltage between countries, and power fluctuations common to low resource settings.",
        "This project aims to further research these challenges, as well as the donation practices of hospitals in Canada, and to identify possible avenues in which this challenge can be addressed and improved."

The challenge was initially brought to the team by a paediatrician in Uganda who expressed the need for a device to actively monitor the respiratory rate of patients, and alert a healthcare professional when the rate drops, or if the breathing becomes shallow. Further investigation showed that often respiratory rate can be difficult to take, and is often neglected as a vital that should be actively monitored. The team hopes to develop a device to address these issues and optimize healthcare professionals’ ability to perform care."

There are a number of challenges associated with this process. For example, patients can be immobile for up to 3 months while undergoing traction, which results in prolonged usage of hospital resources and bed space that is increasingly scarce. This project’s purpose is primarily to research the feasibility of designing a compact device that performs the same mechanics on the leg as traction, but allowing for more patient mobility and decreasing the fracture healing time, thus reducing hospital cost and resource depletion."
