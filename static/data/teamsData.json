I joined BEST in November 2016 and my experience on the Femur Fracture Treatment Project tackling a complex, international healthcare challenge further solidified my goal to pursue a career in biomedical engineering. As a member of BEST, I was amazed at the impact undergraduate students can have on the healthcare industry and I was excited to begin my role as CEO in January 2018.",

For example, the A.T.S. series of automated surgical tourniquet systems and related products manufactured and sold by Zimmer worldwide are based on that research and development. Also, he created Delfi Medical Innovations Inc., a Vancouver-based company, to supply specialty tourniquet-related products invented and developed by the same group.

Worldwide, it is estimated that more than 72 million surgical procedures have been performed using Dr. McEwen’s automatic tourniquet technologies and innovations. Their widespread adoption and use has resulted in significantly improved safety, quality and economy. As a result of the success and widespread impact on the public of his surgical tourniquet-related inventions, in 1997 he received the $100,000 Principal Award for Innovation in Canada from the Ernest C.

At Strait Access Technologies in Cape Town, South Africa, I worked with the R&D team to develop a novel device to repair mitral regurgitation. At Clarius Mobile Health, I worked with the mechanical team to finalize the design of a hand-held, wireless ultrasound device, which is due to be released by the end of 2016.",
