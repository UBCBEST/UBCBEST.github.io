            "Ever since I first became interested in engineering, the innovations that astounded me the most were the biomedical ones. The concept of being able to save someone’s life or improve it through biomedical innovations was so inspiring to me. This drove me to join BEST in the beginning of my first year at UBC and I have been a member of the club ever since. I am currently finishing my fourth year of Electrical Engineering.",
            "When first joining BEST, I was member of the Infectious Disease Emergency Aid - Electronic Medical Records System Project (IDEA – EMR) where I worked on designing and testing the user interface. After the project was completed, I was a member of the Respiratory Rate Monitor Project where I worked on troubleshooting and developing the prototype code. I later then transitioned to the Chief Operations Officer role, and am now serving as BEST’s Chief Executive Officer.",
            "My work experience consists of 3 work terms, one with the Government of Alberta, Department of Economic Development and Trade, where I aided my team in marketing Albertan corporations to attract foreign investment. I also worked with Dynamic Attractions where I worked with robotics to develop ride vehicle systems for the entertainment industry. I also worked as an ICT Engineering Intern with Huawei Technologies, working with mobile/computer networking technologies, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and 5G.",
            "Being a part of BEST has been the highlight of my university career. BEST has given me the chance to develop my technical skills for the past 4 years and I hope to keep contributing to the club’s success by taking on the role of CEO. It is so exciting to be a part of such a talented and driven group of students who are changing the world through biomedical innovation."

In January 2016, the first iteration of the mentorship program began and I got to become a member of IDEA-EMR, a project that finished that May of that same year.  While on IDEA-EMR, I got the chance to apply some of my Java knowledge to help develop the user interface for the app.  Following the completion of IDEA-EMR, I worked with the Music to Movement project developing one of the first software interfaces, as well as designing some of the peripheral internal circuitry.",
            "I have had two co-op experiences so far at UBC, and am currently on my third.  My first co-op was with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering for 4 months, where I got to develop skills with WordPress and Altium Designer.  My second co-op was 8 months with Intel Corporation, where I was a part of a team developing error correction code algorithms for an upcoming product.  I am currently working my third co-op at Kardium Inc., a local biotechnology company.",
