The concept of being able to save someone's life or improve it through biomedical innovations was so inspiring to me. This drove me to join BEST in the beginning of my first year at UBC and I have been a member of the club ever since. I am currently finishing my fourth year of Electrical Engineering.  When first joining BEST, I was member of the Infectious Disease Emergency Aid - Electronic Medical Records System Project (IDEA-EMR) where I worked on designing and testing the user interface.

I later then transitioned to the Chief Operations Officer role, and am now serving as BEST's Chief Executive Officer.  My work experience consists of 3 work terms, one with the Government of Alberta, Department of Economic Development and Trade, where I aided my team in marketing Albertan corporations to attract foreign investment. I also worked with Dynamic Attractions where I worked with robotics to develop ride vehicle systems for the entertainment industry. I also worked as an ICT Engineering Intern with Huawei Technologies, working with mobile/computer networking technologies, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and 5G.  Being a part of BEST has been the highlight of my university career.

                       "I was initially attracted to biomedical engineering and UBC BEST because it combines my two passions, Medicine and Engineering. I had the opportunity to join BEST in my first year at UBC (2015) within the first iteration of the Mentorship Program. At this point in time, I have completed my third year of Electrical Engineering in the Biomedical Option.  When I joined BEST in 2015, my first 4 months with the team were spent doing the non-technical position of Events Coordinator. In January 2016, the first iteration of the mentorship program began and I got to become a member of IDEA-EMR, a project that finished that May of that same year. While on IDEA-EMR, I got the chance to apply some of my Java knowledge to help develop the user interface for the app. Following the completion of IDEA-EMR, I worked with the Music to Movement project developing one of the first software interfaces, as well as designing some of the peripheral internal circuitry.  I have had two co-op experiences so far at UBC, and am currently on my third. My first co-op was with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering for 4 months, where I got to develop skills with WordPress and Altium Designer. My second co-op was 8 months with Intel Corporation, where I was a part of a team developing error correction code algorithms for an upcoming product. I am currently working my third co-op at Kardium Inc., a local biotechnology company.  I am excited to be CTO of BEST, not only because I get to lead such a diverse and talented group of students, but also because I hope to continue to develop and grow impactful and innovative projects, much like my predecessors in this role."

I've always known that I wanted to pursue a creative, challenging and rewarding career that allowed me to help people. However, joining BEST allowed me to realize those goals much earlier than expected.  This team has offered me the opportunity to tackle real-world problems from an engineering perspective, and to witness student projects grow from ideas to fully-fledged devices that help people every day. That's one of the many reasons that it's a privilege to help represent the curious, passionate and talented students that make up this team.  I'm currently in my third year of school, studying Engineering Physics. My biomedical work experience consists of 8 months across two labs in the biomedical research field, with the first focusing on functional neuroimaging and the second on biomechanics and measurements from topographical indices.  This Spring, I'm working as a Product Design Engineering Co-op at MistyWest, a Vancouver-based engineering consultancy that has developed numerous medical devices."
